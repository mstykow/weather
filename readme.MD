# Weather Data Analysis with NumPy & Matplotlib

In this exercise we analyze weather data from the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) surface network, a set of roughly 1000 stations established after the 1992 World Climate Conference for basic planetary climate monitoring. Open the Jupyter Notebook file ([Weather Data Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mstykow/weather/blob/master/Weather%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)) to start the project.

The files readme.txt, stations.txt, RSM00030710.dly, USW00014922.dly, USW00022536.dly, USW00023188.dly were downloaded in January 2019 from the U.S. NOAA Climate Data Online service, and specifically from URLs [ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily) (where stations.txt appears as ghcnd-stations.txt) and [ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/gsn/STATIONCODE.dly](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/gsn/STATIONCODE.dly). The DOI for the GHCN-daily dataset is 10.7289/V5D21VHZ.
