# Weather Data Analysis with NumPy & Matplotlib

In this exercise we analyze weather data from NOAA according to different aspects and practice our plotting skills. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to start the project.

The files readme.txt, stations.txt, RSM00030710.dly, USW00014922.dly, USW00022536.dly, USW00023188.dly were downloaded in January 2019 from the U.S. NOAA Climate Data Online service, and specifically from URLs [ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily) (where stations.txt appears as ghcnd-stations.txt) and [ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/gsn/STATIONCODE.dly](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/gsn/STATIONCODE.dly). The DOI for the GHCN-daily dataset is 10.7289/V5D21VHZ.
